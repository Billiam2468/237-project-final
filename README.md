# 237-project-final
User stories completed:


-Grabbing US and state JSON data from the covidactnow.org API

-Grabbing specific data points from the state json files

-Printing out entire data set received

-Implement menu navigation on command line

-Some values and statistics are properly obtained

-Tests for making sure this grabbing of data is functional were written





User stories to complete next iteration:

-Scrubbing user input

-Grabbing more data points to be used

-Calculating statistics from grabbed data points

-Compiling US data (add up all the states)

-Allow users to navigate backwards in command line menu navigation

-Print out us data in menu navigation Run class

-Print out state data in menu navigation Run class

-Enable graphing of data to compare states (for all types of statistics)



Implemented but doesnt work:
-Working on UI (user input to specify states)

-Not all statistics we want have been implemented (more percentages and ratios)





Commands needed to compile:

javac -cp gson-2.8.6.jar FileParser.java

java -cp gson-2.8.6.jar FileParser.java


Side note:

Since a lot of work was done on UI, there were not many tests other than the statistics we grabbed.

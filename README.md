# 237 Final Project: COVID-19 Dashboard
Our project allows the user to quickly obtain real-time US COVID-19 data for all 50 states, such as the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations, all from the command line. The user can also look up data for a specific state.

### User stories completed:

  -The user can view US and state JSON data from the covidactnow.org API from the terminal

  -The user can search for cases, deaths, and vaccinations for a specific state

  -The user can display data for all states in a table for cases, deaths, vaccinations, and all three at once

  -The user can continue to navigate data via a menu 

  -The user is reprompted if an invalid input was recieved
  
  -Allow users to navigate backwards in command line menu navigation


### User stories to complete next iteration:

  -Grabbing more data points to be used

  -Calculating statistics from grabbed data points

  -Compiling US data (add up all the states)

  -Print out us data in menu navigation Run class

  -Enable graphing of data to compare states (for all types of statistics)



### Implemented but doesnt work:

  -Not all statistics we want have been implemented (more percentages and ratios)



### Commands needed to compile:

Run the run.sh script file in the src folder. Not the one in the cse237 folder
